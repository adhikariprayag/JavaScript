    /*  
        <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
        <button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Try it</button>
    */

    - window object is the "GLOBAL SCOPE" :  everything by default belong to window object

• JS Keywords:

    - var : declare variables
    - let : declared block variables
    - const : declared block constant
    - if 
    - switch
    - for
    - function 
    - return
    - try : implements error handeling for block statements

    //They are reserved and cannot be used as names for a variables

• JS Syntax:
    Js syntax defines two types of Values

    - fixed : literals -> 
                            numbers (written with or without deciamls)
                            strings (written with "" or '')

    - variables -> store data

• JS Variables:

    var = used from 1995 to 2015
    let & const = added in 2015

• Re Declaring:

    - re-declaring variable with var won't loose it's value
        e.g.:   var carName = "Volvo";
                var carName;
        //value will not change

    - cannot re-declare variable declared with "let" and "const"

• Block Scope:

{
    let x = 2;
    //--- x can be accessed here

    //--- let and const are block-scoped
}

//--- x cannot be accessed here
//--- "var" is global scoped
